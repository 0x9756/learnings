## Network Protocols and the Physical Layer
### Network Protocols
-A system of rules that allows two or more entities of a communication system to transmit information via any variation of a physical quantity.

-The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics, an synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods.

-Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both.

#### Basic Requirements
-Data formats of data exchange
-Address formats for data exchange
-Address mapping (i.e. a logical IP address to an Ethernet MAC address)
-Routing
-Detection of transmission errors
-Acknowledgements (of correct reception of packets)
-Loss of information -timeouts and retries
-Direction of information flow
-Sequence control
-Flow control (when the sender is transmitting faster than equipment can process)
-Queueing (buffers)
